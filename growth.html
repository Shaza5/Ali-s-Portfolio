                    <p>In my Access lessons, I have honed various skills that have significantly enriched my language proficiency. Firstly, my grasp of grammar and syntax has markedly improved, enabling me to construct more articulate and grammatically sound sentences. Additionally, my vocabulary has expanded, allowing me to express ideas with greater precision and nuance.
                        Through reading and analyzing diverse texts, I have developed strong comprehension skills, enhancing my ability to understand complex passages and extract key information.

        <p>My window's stunning view
            Rainy day, all the people were hiding in their houses, and it was
            raining cats and dogs, I was afraid like a coward. The moon was
            hidden behind the clouds, with no light in the sky. Raindrops invaded
            the ground. The air wages war on nature and they composed songs
            with the help of trees. Winter view showed the key to life from seeing,
            hear, touching, smelling, and tasting nature's secret.
            I stood behind my window where the view was so scary I heard a loud
            sound coming from a big storm, it looked like a whirlwind wanted to
            eat nature, also the water drops knocked the ground but their
            twittering made me feel relaxed. then, windy air blew and kissed my
            skin It was so cold, and my hair stood up like the soldiers in the war
            through this cold air.
            I pieced my vision and I saw trees dancing like dancers on stage
            through air trails Suddenly, the rain stopped and I smelled the earthy
            and fresh odor, it was a soil smell. My window is full of dew drops that
            touch was soft and cool. I put some of these drops on my tongue it's
            taste was so salty.
            Standing there, seeing this scenery I felt a special connection, the
            winter is full of mysteries. the winter was more than rain and air drop
            it was a magical season containing phenomena. Now, I called my
            window by the window of life.

            productivity
